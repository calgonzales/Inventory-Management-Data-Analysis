# Inventory Management Data Analysis for A Liquor Merchandise Entity

The liquor merchandise entity operates as a medium-sized manufacturing company specializing in the sale of diverse liquor brands. Offering an extensive range of products, they manage inventories encompassing raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. However, the company has encountered challenges in inventory management, such as stockouts, excess inventory, and rising carrying costs. In response to these issues, my goal is to initiate a comprehensive inventory analysis to pinpoint areas for enhancement and optimize their overall inventory management practices.

Objectives:
The inventory management plan involves maintaining detailed records of all transactions, including purchases, production, sales, and adjustments. It includes analyzing historical sales data for demand forecasting, determining optimal order quantities with Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) analysis, calculating reorder points, assessing lead times, analyzing carrying costs, identifying process improvements, and evaluating inventory turnover ratios. The deliverables will encompass comprehensive insights and recommendations based on these analyses to enhance overall inventory management efficiency.
